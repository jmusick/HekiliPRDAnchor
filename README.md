# HekiliPRDAnchor
A World of Warcraft addon to reposition Hekili buttons relative to the Personal Resource Display.

## Usage
- Adds functionality to dynamically anchor Hekili buttons to the Personal Resource Display.
- No configuration needed; simply install and reload your UI.

## Limitations
I couldn't figure out how to get it to anchor to the HekiliPrimary frame so I had to attach the buttons individually so if you use more than 2 button displays, it probably won't work.

## Installation
1. Copy the script into your WoW `Interface/AddOns` folder.
2. Reload your UI in-game.
